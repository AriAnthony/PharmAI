# Population PK/PD Analysis Plan for Hypertension Drug Development

## Study Context
- Indication: Hypertension
- Comparator: Lisinopril
- Trial Phase: Phase 3 Efficacy

## Specific Considerations for Hypertension PopPK Analysis
1. Key Covariates to Investigate:
   - Age
   - Body weight
   - Renal function (eGFR)
   - Concomitant antihypertensive medications
   - Sex
   - Ethnicity

2. Unique Hypertension-Specific Analysis Objectives:
   - Characterize drug exposure in relation to blood pressure reduction
   - Assess variability in antihypertensive response
   - Compare pharmacokinetic profile with Lisinopril
   - Evaluate potential dose adjustments for special populations

## Data Collection Considerations
- Collect intensive PK sampling in a subset of patients
- Ensure blood pressure measurements aligned with PK sampling
- Capture comprehensive covariate information
- Document concomitant medications and their potential interactions

## Modeling Approach
- Develop a base structural model using 1- or 2-compartment pharmacokinetic structure
- Incorporate physiologically-relevant covariates
- Use nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM)
- Perform Visual Predictive Checks (VPC)
- Conduct bootstrap analysis for parameter uncertainty

## Special Hypertension Analysis Elements
- Exposure-response analysis for blood pressure reduction
- Simulation of dosing strategies across different patient subgroups
- Assessment of dose-response relationship
- Evaluation of inter-individual variability in drug response

The analysis plan follows standard regulatory guidelines while addressing the specific nuances of a hypertension drug development program.
