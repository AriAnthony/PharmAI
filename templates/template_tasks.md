# Population PK/PD Analysis Plan - Hierarchical Task Structure

This document provides a hierarchical breakdown of tasks for executing a comprehensive population PK/PD analysis plan. Tasks are organized by execution type (sequential vs parallel) to facilitate project planning and delegation.

## Task Execution Notes

- **Sequential tasks** must be completed in the specified order within each section
- **Parallel tasks** can be delegated to different team members or executed simultaneously
- Major phases (1-7) should generally be completed in order, though some overlap is possible
- Quality control checkpoints should be implemented between major phases
- All tasks should reference the original analysis plan template for detailed specifications
