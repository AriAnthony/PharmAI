*Content:* A concise bullet list of objectives (text). Often restated verbatim from the Statistical/Analysis Plan.

## Methods

*(Summary of methods, written in past tense. Reference the final approved analysis plan by version/date.)*

### Analysis Data

* **Data Sources**: List all clinical studies and trials included (with identifiers), specifying the phase and population (e.g. healthy vs patient).
* **Data Assembly**: Describe how data were pooled or split; handle between-study differences.
* **Dataset Summary**: Number of subjects, number of PK observations, sampling schemes, and any excluded data (e.g. dropouts, protocol deviations). Mention any handling of Below-LLOQ data or outliers.
* **Subject Demographics**: Summarize key characteristics (age, weight, gender, race, renal/hepatic function, concomitant meds). *Include a table of demographics and baseline characteristics.*.
* **Analysis Plan**: Reference the analysis plan (version/date) and note any deviations from it in execution. (The analysis plan itself may be included in Appendix.)

*Content:* Primarily text description supported by **tables** (e.g. study/trial summary table, demographics table) and possibly a figure (e.g. spaghetti plot of observed concentrations vs time) if helpful. Include links to source documents (e.g. study reports) as applicable.

### Software and Environment

* Mention operating system, platforms, and any specialized toolkits/packages (e.g. PsN, Xpose) used for model building or plots.
* Optionally note computational resources if relevant (e.g. high-performance computing cluster).

*Content:* Bullet list or short paragraph. Reviewers should be able to reproduce the work knowing the software environment.

### Modeling Methodology

Summarize the modeling and analysis approach (text and bullet points):

* **Structural Model**: Describe the final base model. E.g. “A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination described the concentration–time data.” Include equations or compartment diagrams as needed.
* **Covariate Analysis**: Outline how covariates were evaluated (e.g. “Covariates were screened using a stepwise forward-inclusion (p<0.01)/backward-elimination (p<0.001) approach based on likelihood ratio tests.”). List which covariates were tested and retained.
* **Variability Models**: State the final inter-individual variability (IIV) and residual error models. E.g. “IIV was modeled log-normally on CL and V; residual error was modeled as a combined proportional+additive error.”
* **Estimation Methods**: Specify estimation algorithm (e.g. FOCEI in NONMEM v7.4) and any alternate methods (e.g. SAEM).
* **Data Handling**: Briefly note handling of BQL data (e.g. M3 method) and missing covariates/imputation approaches.
* **Model-Building Strategy**: A narrative outline of how the final model was reached. You can bullet key steps (e.g. “Base structural model → added IIV terms → tested body weight as covariate on CL → evaluated others…”) referencing changes in the objective function. A **model development table** (in the Appendix) can support this (recommended).

*Content:* Text summary of model components and strategy, plus possibly a **table** (in either the body or Appendix) showing model-building steps and objective function changes. Include equations or diagrams for the final model. List assumptions and provide rationale (e.g. why certain covariates were not tested).

Describe how the model was evaluated:

* **Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) Diagnostics**: e.g. DV vs. PRED/IPRED plots, weighted residuals plots, etc.
* **Predictive Checks**: e.g. Visual Predictive Check (VPC), Prediction-corrected VPC. Specify number of simulations, confidence intervals.
* **Bootstrap or Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR)**: If used for parameter uncertainty, note number of replicates and software.
* **Other Diagnostics**: e.g. Normalized Prediction Distribution Errors (NPDE), nonparametric predictive checks, shrinkage estimates.
* **Sensitivity Analyses**: Mention any sensitivity analyses (e.g. to handling of outliers, BQL method).

*Content:* Text listing all evaluation methods. Detailed GOF/VPC results go in Results, but here state *which* methods and settings were used.

*(The table should reflect final parameterization and include covariate effect size if applicable. Report IIV as CV% and precision as %RSE.)*

### Covariate Effects

* **Quantitative Impact**: Summarize how each significant covariate affects PK parameters. E.g. “CL increases 1.5% per year of age”, or “subjects with renal impairment have 30% lower CL”.
* **Tables/Figures**: Include a **table** of covariate effect sizes (e.g. percent change per covariate increment) and/or a **forest plot** of covariate effects on exposure (AUC, C\_max).
* **Clinical Relevance**: Comment on whether the effect is clinically meaningful (e.g. “the effect of weight on CL is minor and does not warrant dose adjustment”).

*Content:* Text explanation of covariate impacts supported by **tables or graphs**. For example, a figure showing 90% confidence intervals of exposure changes for covariate subgroups.

### Model Evaluation and Diagnostics

Present and interpret the results of model qualification:

* **Goodness-of-Fit Plots**: Include representative GOF plots (Observed vs. Predicted, residuals, etc.) for the **final model**. Each plot should have a brief interpretation caption.
* **VPC/Simulation-Based Checks**: Show the final Visual Predictive Check (with prediction intervals) stratified by relevant factors if needed. Describe how well the model predicts central tendency and variability.
* **Bootstrap/SIR Results**: If bootstrap or other resampling was performed, include summary results (e.g. median estimates vs bootstrap medians, confidence intervals).
* **Other Diagnostics**: Report on any NPDE or other checks. If shrinkage was high (e.g. >20-30%), comment on its implications.
* **Diagnostic Interpretation**: For each set of plots, briefly state whether model assumptions appear valid (e.g. no trends in residuals) and any caveats.

*Content:* Key plots (Figure format) should be embedded or referenced (GOF, VPC, etc.) with captions. Tables can summarize bootstrap or NPDE statistics. Ensure all figures are clearly labeled (e.g. “Figure 2: VPC showing model vs observed percentiles”). Discuss results in the text. Include only **final** model diagnostics here (earlier model plots can go to Appendix).

### Simulation Results (if applicable)

* **Simulation Purpose**: State the goal of simulations (e.g. “to predict steady-state exposure under alternative dosing regimens” or “to evaluate percent of population above efficacy threshold”).
* **Scenarios**: Describe any alternative dosing or population scenarios simulated.
* **Results**: Present the outcomes as **plots** (e.g. simulated concentration-time profiles, target attainment vs dose) and/or **summary tables** (e.g. median C\_max, 90% intervals for each regimen).
* **Interpretation**: Comment on what the simulations imply (e.g. “Simulations indicate that a 30 mg dose in subjects <50 kg achieves similar exposure as 50 mg in heavier subjects”).

*Content:* Figures and tables summarizing simulation scenarios. If no simulations were done, this section can be omitted or noted as “Not Applicable.” Keep descriptions concise and link back to objectives.

## Discussion

### Summary of Findings

* Restate the main outcomes: final model structure and fits, key covariate effects, and any surprising findings.
* Emphasize the most critical results in plain language (for example, “Clearance was estimated to be \_\_\_ and was not influenced by gender, but decreased with worsening renal function”).

### Clinical and Strategic Implications

* Explain how results impact drug development or use: e.g. dose adjustments, labeling recommendations, study design. (“Based on these findings, no dose adjustment is needed for subjects up to 80 years old.”)
* If relevant, discuss how the model supports efficacy or safety conclusions (e.g. exposure–response predictions).
* Consider how findings compare with expectations or published literature.

### Strengths and Limitations

* **Strengths**: e.g. large dataset, robust evaluation, consistency with previous analyses.
* **Limitations**: e.g. sparse data in certain subgroups, assumptions (like linear kinetics), or high uncertainty in some parameters. Discuss data/model gaps and their potential impact.
* Note any assumptions that could not be tested (e.g. untested covariates due to limited variability).

*Content:* Text narrative. Interpret results critically, citing relevant literature or guidelines if it supports your conclusions. This is a balanced appraisal in regulatory context.

## Conclusions

A brief (a few sentences) bullet or paragraph summary of the main takeaways:

* Conclude on whether objectives were met (e.g. “Objectives were achieved; the final model reliably describes the PK data.”).
* State any concrete recommendations (e.g. dosing, monitoring).
* Emphasize the overall impact (e.g. “This analysis supports the recommended dose of X mg and identifies no special dosing in population Y.”).

*Content:* Concise text in plain language, reflecting the Executive Summary but framed as final answers.
